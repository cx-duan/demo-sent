# Demo - Sentiment Analysis for each Entity

## Description:
This demo was put together to showcase possible applications of AssemblyAI's API. Processing the JSON file returned after processing audio, a user can display a dashboard showing sentiment analysis for each entity identified in the audio file. The website displays a pie-chart of a sentiment analysis overview (positive, negative, neutral) distributions as well as a high-level list of entities and correlating sentiment.

File contains:
- Sentiment overview for call (Pie Chart)    
- Sentiment of an Entity (List)
- Number of sentences
