#Demo - Sentiment analysis for each entity

Description: 
Sentiment overview for call
Sentiment of an Entity

This demo was put together to showcase possible applications of AssemblyAI's API. Processing the JSON file returned after processing audio, a user can display a dashboard showing sentiment analysis for each entity identified in the audio file. The website displays a pie-chart of a sentiment analysis overview (positive, negative, neutral) distributions as well as a high-level list of entities and correlating sentiment.

## Need to add ability to upload own file.

To run Python file:
python3 -m streamlit run sentiment-entity-overview.py 

To run website via StreamLit:
python3 -m streamlit run sentiment-entity-overview.py
